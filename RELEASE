0.99 Release "Ocean Big Chair"
------------------------------

This is the ninth release for the new version of Pitivi based on GES,
the GStreamer Editing Services library. This is a bug-fix release, and
can be considered a release candidate for version 1.0.

Many performance improvements have been made, and many bugs have been fixed.


== Requirements ==

For this release, we depend on GStreamer, Gst-Python, GES 1.12.3.

We now use Gnome GSound instead of pycanberra.

We now depend on gst-devtools for tests.

We got rid of `configure` and `Makefile`, and now rely on Meson and Ninja.
See http://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html for an intro.

Refer to Pitivi's check.py for the dependencies' versions for this release.
