short-description: How to update the sandbox used by the Pitivi development environment
...

# Updating the sandbox

We use the same [Flatpak
manifest](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/blob/master/build/flatpak/org.pitivi.Pitivi.json)
for both the [development environment](HACKING.md) sandbox and for the [nightly
build snapshot](Install_with_flatpak.md).

To have the CI run the tests as fast as possible, we use a Docker image with
all the sandbox dependencies cached. This image needs to be updated whenever
we want to update the manifest, otherwise the CI fails since it can't download
the latest dependencies.

## Update the flatpak runtime

To update the flatpak runtime version, look in `org.pitivi.Pitivi.json` for the
current version:

```
    "runtime-version": "41",
```

Check out what is the latest flatpak runtime version. For example:

```
$ flatpak remote-ls flathub --system | grep org.gnome.Platform
GNOME Application Platform version 3.38	org.gnome.Platform		3.38
GNOME Application Platform version 40	org.gnome.Platform		40
GNOME Application Platform version 41	org.gnome.Platform		41
```

Check out in the git history how we updated the runtime version in the past and
replace it with the latest release.


## Update the sandbox dependencies

Some of them can be updated automatically with
[flatpak-external-data-checker](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-external-data-checker):

```
$ flatpak run --filesystem=$HOME/dev/pitivi/pitivi org.flathub.flatpak-external-data-checker build/flatpak/org.pitivi.Pitivi.json --update
```

Others have to be checked and updated manually.

Most of the [Python dependencies](Updating_Python_dependencies.md) can be
updated with `flatpak-pip-generator`.


## Check the Python version

The "gst-python" module in the manifest specifies the "pygi-overrides-dir"
parameter which contains a path which must target the correct Python version.

Pay attention to update this path when the Python version changes.


## Rebuild your local dev env

```
$ . bin/pitivi-env
(ptv-flatpak) $ ptvenv --update
```

Run the tests:

```
(ptv-flatpak) $ ptvtests
```

If all goes well, push the branch to origin to be able to initiate the
generation of the CI image.

```
$ git checkout -b sdk
$ git push origin sdk
```


## Build the CI image

The "Build docker image for the CI" [GitLab
Schedule](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/pipeline_schedules) rebuilds
every 24h the image we use for running the unittests. This image caches
the build of dependencies described in our Flatpak manifest.

Since it's using the "master" branch, you have to create a new schedule and
select the branch you just pushed ("sdk"). Leave Active unchecked.

Go back to the Schedules page and click the Play button of the schedule you just
created to start a pipeline. Notice in the Last Pipeline column a link to the
pipeline you just started.

After the pipeline succeeds, create a regular MR with your manifest changes and
notice the CI is green. If you fail to merge the MR, the "Build docker image for
the CI" will kick in later and recreate the image according to the manifest on
branch "master".
