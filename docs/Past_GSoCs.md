# Past GSoCs

See [Google Summer of Code](Google_Summer_of_Code.md) for how to
get involved.

## 2017

-   [Fabián Orccón](https://github.com/jakubbrindza) implemented a
    [plugin system](http://www.jakubbrindza.com/2016/08/gsoc-with-pitivi.html)
    which has been merged. Unfortunately we noticed too late the excellent
    additional Developer Console plugin he developed was based on code which is
    not compatible with our license, so until that part is rewritten we can't
    merge it.
-   [Suhas Nayak](https://suhas2go.github.io) implemented a [framework for
    supporting custom UI for effects](https://suhas2go.github.io/gnome/pitivi/2017/08/28/GSoCFinalReport/),
    instead of the UI generated automatically. Suhas used the new framework to
    provide a polished UI for the `frei0r-filter-3-point-color-balance` and
    `alpha` effects.
-   [Ștefan-Adrian Popa](https://stefanpopablog.wordpress.com) implemented
    the UI for the [Ken-Burns
    effect](https://stefanpopablog.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/gsoc-2017-coming-to-an-end/),
    including keyframing the placement and zoom of the clips by interacting with
    the viewer. Additionally, Ștefan fixed a lot of bugs [most of them unrelated
    to his main
    task](https://gist.github.com/stefanzzz22/260fa2be10bccd7404af87152ecd5a88).

## 2016

-   [Jakub Brindza](https://github.com/jakubbrindza) implemented
    [customizable keyboard
    shortcuts](http://www.jakubbrindza.com/2016/08/gsoc-with-pitivi.html).

## 2014

-   [Fabián Orccón](http://cfoch-dev.tumblr.com/) worked on the Pitivi,
    GES, GStreamer stack to allow using image sequences.
-   [Lubosz Sarnecki](https://lubosz.wordpress.com/) worked on
    implementing a new OpenGL based transformation effect to be used for
    the transformation UI.

## 2013

-   Anton Belka worked on the initial
    implementation of proxies in [GES](GES.md) (see [proxy
    editing requirements](design/proxy_editing_requirements.md)).
-   Mathieu Duponchelle worked on heavy
    bugfixing all across the Pitivi, [GES](GES.md) and GStreamer
    stack, allowing us to release [0.91](releases/0.91.md) at the end of
    the summer.
-   Joris Valette started work on
    slow/fast-motion in GStreamer.
-   [Simon Corsin](https://github.com/rFlex) worked on various pieces
    alongside Mathieu, such as the new waveforms renderer.

## 2012

-   Matas Brazdeikis implemented a new UI [Test
    suite](Testing.md) using Dogtail. He also started the
    implementation of a title editing user interface.
-   Paul Lange implemented a manual layer
    controls user interface for the timeline.
-   Volodymyr Rudoy spent some time
    designing the GES “Materials” (now known as Assets) API.

All the work above has been merged and is expected to be available in
the [0.91](releases/0.91.md) release.

In addition, we also co-mentored Peteris Krisjanis who worked on an
audio waveform generation and display library for GStreamer (see his
[post-summer
report](http://pecisk.blogspot.ca/2012/11/state-of-libwaveform-after-gsoc.html)).

## 2011

-   Feroze Naina worked on adding profiles for
    rendering.
-   Mathieu Duponchelle started to port
    PiTiVi to GES after having worked on the GES Python bindings and the
    GES Pitivi formatter.
-   [Lubosz Sarnecki](https://lubosz.wordpress.com/) implemented a nifty
    user interface for [resizing/cropping clips directly in the
    viewer](https://lubosz.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/making-viewer-uis-for-pitivi/).

Feroze and Lubosz's work has been merged and made available in the
[0.15](releases/0.15.md) release. Mathieu's work has also been merged, to
be part of the [0.91](releases/0.91.md) release.

## 2010

-   Thibault Saunier implemented with the
    core backend developers special effects. He also worked in close
    collaboration with nekohayo for the user
    interface and testing.

Thibault's work has been merged in September/October 2010 and is
expected to be available to users in releases &gt;0.13.5.

## 2008

-   Brandon Lewis worked on the [advanced
    timeline](http://dotsony.blogspot.ch/search?updated-min=2008-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2009-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=41).
-   [Sarath Lakshman](http://www.sarathlakshman.com/about/) implemented
    [webcam
    capture](http://www.sarathlakshman.com/2008/09/28/pitivi-hacks).

## 2007

-   Brandon Lewis worked on the [simple
    timeline](Google_SoC_2007_-_Simple_Timeline.md).
