# Testing

We have tree sets of tests:
 - the normal unit tests (ninja test)
 - integration tests using GstValidate.
 - [manual tests](QA_Scenarios.md)

Since version [0.91](releases/0.91.md), our backend test suite is much
smaller and simpler; since most of the core functionality is now handled
by [GES](GES.md), you need to run GES's test suite instead if
you want to test more thoroughly.

## Unit tests

You can run the unit tests with:

```
ninja -C mesonbuild/ test
```

If you want to run only one particular unit test, use:

```
gst-validate-launcher tests/ptv_testsuite.py -t tests.test_project.TestProjectManager.testLoadProjectFailedUnknownFormat
```

Listing tests:

```
gst-validate-launcher tests/ptv_testsuite.py -L
```

### Writing unit tests

As mock library we use [Mock](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/),
as it's now integrated into
[Python3](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock) which we use
as of [0.94](releases/0.94.md).

If you're curious about our unit tests, the best way to get to know them
is to write a few Pitivi unit tests and have us review them. Check out
[how to set up your dev env](HACKING.md) and
come in our [IRC channel](http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contact)!

## Integration tests

The integration tests are run with GstValidate. They are located in the
[tests/validate-tests](https://git.gnome.org/browse/pitivi/tree/tests/validate-tests)
directory. Each `.scenario` file in the
[scenarios](https://github.com/pitivi/pitivi/tree/master/tests/validate-tests/scenarios)
subdirectory contains a sequence of actions which represent a test.

When a test is run, the actions in the scenario are performed by
handlers in
[pitivi/utils/validate.py](https://github.com/pitivi/pitivi/blob/master/pitivi/utils/validate.py),
or by handlers in GES. The handlers generally act on the widgets and
check the expected effect has been obtained on the GES objects. Besides
the checks integrated in the handlers, for now it is not possible to
have additional checks.

A scenario file is [created
automatically](http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/Bug_reporting#Sharing_sample_files.2C_projects.2C_and_.22scenarios.22)
each time Pitivi is used.

You can run the integration tests with:

```
tests/validate-tests/runtests
```
